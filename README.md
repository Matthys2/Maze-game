# Maze game

I have created a randomly generating maze game, you can do these things (in the V2 version)

- Create endless random mazes up to any size your pc can handle
- zoom in and out
- Download a maze
- Save progress in your maze
- View where you have been

# Updates

I will still be updating his game with updates. Only the V2 version will be updated.

Things I want to add to the game are:

- Create custom mazes
